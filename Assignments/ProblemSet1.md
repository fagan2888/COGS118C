**Exercises from van Drongelen**:
- **Chapter 2**: 2.2 (see Ch2 page 24), 2.5
- **Chapter 4**: 4.5a,b
- **Chapter 6**: 6.4 (see page 109, 6.3.1), 6.5:

A note on the table for 6.4: I jumped the gun in lecture on this one, we derived in class that we cannot distinguish anything with frequency greater or equal to fs, with the last wave number corresponding to frequency (N-1)/T. So in Table 6.4, the answer you would give given your knowledge as of today would be fs (or s, from column 2).

**However**, what I tried to explain to you after bumbling on this is that we can actually only distinguish up to a frequency of fs/2, so the total range, F, is fs/2.

Imagine the clock with wave number k=N/2. At each time step, it jumps to the opposite side of the clock, but we donâ€™t know which direction it took, and anything higher than that frequency gets interpreted as the negative of a smaller wave number. The bonus section in your lab should explain this more verbosely.

**So, for these questions and your midterm**, the answer to the last column in the table for exercise 6.4 should always be F = fs/2 (see provided answer)
